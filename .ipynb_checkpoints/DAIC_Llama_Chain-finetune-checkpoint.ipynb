What's been the most difficult part of this situation for you? Participant: Honestly, it's been just feeling like my partner doesn't care about me anymore. It's like they're just tolerating me and not really trying to connect with me or understand me. Ellie: Okay. Well, we can definitely work on that.

feels  like  climbing  a  mountain,  so  yeah  Ellie:  that  makes  sense  Participant:  got  it  Ellie:  what  do  you  usually  do  on  a  typical  day  Participant:  um,  pretty  much  i  spend  most  of  my  time  indoors,  trying  to  create  some  kind  of  art,  whether  it's  painting,  drawing,  or  whatever,  just  to  keep  my  hands  busy,  and  my  mind  active,  so  yeah  Ellie:  that  sounds  like  a  great  way  to  spend  your  time  Participant:  yeah  Ellie:  do  you  ever  feel  like  you're  just  going  through  the  motions,  like  you're  just  existing,  rather

 feeling  like  you're  drowning  in  quicksand,  so  yeah  Ellie:  how  do  you  handle  those  days  when  it  feels  like  everything  is  just  too  much  Participant:  um,  well,  i  try  to  just  slow  down,  take  deep  breaths,  and  try  to  focus  on  something  that  brings  me  joy,  like  listening  to  music,  or  watching  a  funny  video,  and  just  trying  to  let  go  of

repeating  the  same  patterns  over  and  over   Participant:  yeah,  i  think  everyone  experiences  that  feeling  at  some  point  in  their  lives,  but  with  depression,  it  can  feel  like

about  a  time  when  someone  made  you  feel  really  badly  about  yourself  Participant:  um,  yeah,  i  would  say  it  was  a  time  when  someone  made  a  comment  about  my  art,  and  how  it  was  'nothing  special'  and  how  i  should  just  give  up  on  it,  and  that  really  hurt,  and  made  me  feel  like  i  was  worthless,  and  that  my  art  was  nothing  of  value,  so  yeah  Ellie:  that  sounds  really  tough  Participant:  yeah,  it  was  really  hard  to  deal  with,  but  i  think  that's  where  having  a  good  support  system  comes  in,  you  know,  people  who  care  about  you,  and  believe  in  you,  and  encourage  you  to  keep  going,  even  when  things  seem  hopeless,  so  yeah  Ellie:  wow  Participant:  *sigh*,  but,  i  think  that's  where

hopeless,  so  yeah  Ellie:  is  there  anything  you  regret  Participant:  um,  yeah,  i  think  one  of  the  biggest  regrets  i  have  is  not  pursuing  my  passion  for  art  when  i  was  younger,  and  allowing  my  fears  and  doubts  to  hold  me  back,  so  yeah,  that's  pretty  heavy  Ellie:  wow  Participant:  *sigh*,  but,  i  think  that's  where  the  importance  of  taking  risks  comes  in,  you  know,  stepping  out  of  your  comfort  zone,  and  trying  new  things,  even  when  they  scare  you,  so  yeah  Ellie:  have  you  ever  thought  about  seeking  professional  help  for  your  depression  Participant:  i  think  it's  definitely  something  i've  thought  about,  but  i've  just  never  really  taken  the  plunge,  you  know,  it's  hard  to  admit  that  i  need  help,  and  it's  even  harder  to  ask  for  help,  so  yeah,  that's  been  a  hurdle  i've  had  to  overcome  Ellie:  wow  Participant:  *sigh*,  but,  i  think  that's

add  Participant:  um,  yeah,  i  think  one  of  the  most  important  things  is  to  remember  that  depression  is  a  journey,  and  it's  okay  to  not  be  okay,  and  it's  okay  to  ask  for  help,  so  yeah,  just  trying  to  spread  awareness,  and  to  encourage  people  to  talk  about  their  struggles,  and  to  seek  help  when  they  need  it,  so  yeah  Ellie:  thank  you  for  sharing  your  story  with  me  Participant:  thank  you  for  listening,  it's  been  really  helpful  to  share  my  story  with  someone,  so  yeah,  thank  you  Ellie:  take  care  Participant:
